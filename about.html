        <p>Hey there! I'm a New Jersey native, and I moved to the Seattle area in 2004. I live in Capitol Hill with my husband and our doggo. In my downtime, I love to cook, bake and explore new cuisines. My other hobbies include singing, drawing and playing video games.</p>
        <p>I've always been excited about web development, and started teaching myself HTML and CSS way back in the 90s. I started my career in 2001 doing web design for a group of major market radio stations. After a detour into retail management, I began working for an e-commerce company in 2012. This position renewed my passion for web development, and while I was able to put my skills to use again, I also realized they needed a refresh. Changing careers to front end development became my goal, and I took action to pursue this in 2017 by enrolling in the University of Washington's certificate program. It was an incredibly rewarding program, which allowed me update my knowledge and add a variety of new skills.</p>
        <p>If I had to choose my favorite language, it would have to be CSS, but JavaScript is quickly moving up the list. The possibilities for engaging visual design and good UX have become almost limitless!</p>
        <p>Let's talk!</p>
